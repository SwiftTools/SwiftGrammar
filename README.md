# SwiftGrammar

Swift grammar allows to parse swift code using ANTLR generated parser

This project is not production-ready. It is not tested enough. This project uses Antlr-Swift-Runtime by janyou, which is also not released yet. You can contribute either to this project or to https://github.com/janyou/Antlr-Swift-Runtime

If you are familiar with Java or ANTLRv4, consider also this project: https://github.com/janyou/ANTLR-Swift-Target It generates parser and lexer.
